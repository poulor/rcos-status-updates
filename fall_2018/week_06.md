## Last Week's Accomplishments

> So decided that we are not going to actually delete any of the petitions. In fact no delete function will be created instead we will be "hiding" anything we don't want to be shown.

## This Week's Plan

> Implement "hiding functions"
> Specifically hiding a petition - shouldn't be too hard

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A

## Notes

> Is there a need to delete tags? Or simply hide them like petitions?
> Looks like we will cross this bridge when we get there.
