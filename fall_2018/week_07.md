## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Implemented hiding petition function as well as unhide.

> Implemented create tag, attempted to create a delete tag?

> Implemented get_initals, get_name, and get_status for User class

> Ready for first commit?

## This Week's Plan
> So turns out Ishita also implemented most of aforementioned functions (I mistakenly was referencing master instead of the branch pertaining to the model)

> Mostly my fault due to bad coordination and inexperience with GitHub, so we just compared functions and they were almost entirely identical

> Work on function to check if user is a member of the union (actually checked the correct branch and with Ishita this time)

> Noticed an error in the read me - Grace said I could fix


## Anything Blocking?

> N/A

## Notes
