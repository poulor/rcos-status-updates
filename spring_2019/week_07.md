# Status Update Week 7

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Still learning how to implement functionality

## This Week's Plan

> Implement the functionality - like actually creating the petition

## Anything Blocking?

> Specifically the petitions I am "creating" are not being created at all - not showing up in the database

## Notes

> I am going to ask Jeffery if he knows anything about forms

> Reading up on creating forms from models: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/forms/modelforms/>
