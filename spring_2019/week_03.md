# Status Update Week 3

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished most of the NetNinja tutorial on Django

## This Week's Plan

> Figure out which part of the front end I want to do
> Start looking into how to build a front end
> Don't have much experience in CSS/HTML/Bootstrap so I would have a bit of self-teaching to do

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A

## Notes

> Didn't get as much work as I would have liked this week
> Had 2 exams and I had the stomach bug earlier this week
> Talked to Grace today about possibly trying out a part of the front end - the create petition page
