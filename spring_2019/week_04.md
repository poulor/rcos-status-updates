# Status Update Week 4

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Deciding that I was going to start working on the create petition front end

> Andrew O already started working on it so I am taking the reigns from him

> Grace has a very bare bones version as well so I am working on combining the two and taking what is needed

## This Week's Plan

> Not familiar at all with HTML, CSS or Boostrap so will be learning that as I look through Andrew's code

> Add on to the code based on the wireframe on the github wiki

## Anything Blocking?

> N/A
