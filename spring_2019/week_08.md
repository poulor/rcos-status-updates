# Status Update Week 8

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Made a decent amount of progress with my issue pertaining to creating a petition and storing it into the data base with Grace's help

## This Week's Plan

> Finish implementing creation and storage of new petition instances.

> Use a class view style instead of current style where get and post are two separate functions

> Class style allows for get and post to be methods


## Anything Blocking?

> Have to use a class view style for the views so that after the creation of a petition /create/ can be used for getting the new petition page and posting a new petition to the database

## Notes

> N/A
