# Status Update Week 10

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Mostly worked on presentation (slides and demo)

## This Week's Plan

> Integrate working backend (last week's accomplishment) with custom html created weeks ago

> Going to see if I can store all my custom html in style.css


## Anything Blocking?
> Things I change in style.css does not affect create.html (when it should). Andrew and I tried to figure it out but our efforts were futile, not exactly sure how to proceed going to try again later

## Notes
